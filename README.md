# FrontEnd

Welcome to Well Plated! Our goal is to build a social network that allows users to share recipes with each other. 


These are the steps to start up the project after cloning:

`cd api`

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

`cd ..`

`npm install`

`npm start`

Once you have our project open, you can explore our different pages and upload recipes of your own!
